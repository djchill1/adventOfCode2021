# adventOfCode2021
My solutions to advent of code 2021 problems.

Most days have the following:
* a numbered *.py file, the equivalent of 'main' for that day.
* a numbered *_input.txt file containing the sample input for that day.
* a numbered test_*.py file, containing unittest cases for the day.

Example files:
* 1.py - main for day 1.
* test_1.py - unittests for day 1.
* 1_input.txt - input list for day 1.
